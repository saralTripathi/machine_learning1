        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "   What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -  Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
        "    - Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. The value of the correlation coefficient for a negative correlation ranges from -1 to 0. A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, while a value closer to 0 indicates a weaker negative linear relationship.\n",

        "    -  The loss value is a key metric in machine learning that helps determine how well a model is performing.\n",
        "    - The loss measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values (ground truth). It quantifies how wrong the model is on a single data point or a batch.\n",
        "    - Lower loss = better predictions\n",
        "    - Higher loss = worse predictions\n",
        "    - As training progresses, a decreasing loss typically indicates that the model is learning and improving.\n",
        "    - If the loss stays high or fluctuates a lot, it might mean the model is not learning properly.\n",
        "    - If training loss is low but validation loss is high, your model is likely overfitting (memorizing training data but not generalizing well).\n",
        "    - If both training and validation losses are high, the model is underfitting (not learning enough).\n",
        "    - Loss â‰  Accuracy: A model can have a low loss but not necessarily high accuracy, especially in classification tasks. Loss provides more fine-grained feedback than accuracy.\n",

        "\n",
        "        - Understand Target Variable:is it imblanced or balanced\n",
        "        - Imbalanced data needs special handling (e.g., SMOTE, class weights).\n",

        "\n",
        "        -  For regression with outliers â†’ avoid RMSE, maybe use MAE.\n",
        "\n",
        "        - EDA prevents you from blindly fitting a model. It improves model quality, reduces errors, and often leads to valuable feature engineering and better decisions.\n",
        "12. What is correlation?\n",
        "    - Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.\n",
        "    - It tells you how closely two variables move together.\n",
        "    - Correlation values range between -1 and 1:\n",
        "        - +1 â†’ perfect positive correlation: both variables increase together.\n",
        "        - 0 â†’ no correlation: variables are unrelated.\n",
        "        - -1 â†’ perfect negative correlation: one increases, the other decreases.\n",
        "    - Helps in feature selection.\n",
        "    - Detects multicollinearity (high correlation between features).\n",
        "    - Avoids redundant data in models like linear regression.\n",
        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",

        "    - Ex: Pushing a ball (X) causes it to move (Y).\n",
        "        This is a direct cause-effect relationship.\n",
        "    - Correlation does NOT imply causation.Just because two things happen together doesnâ€™t mean one causes the other.\n",
        "    - A classic example to illustrate the difference is the correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents.\n",
        "         - Correlation: You might observe a strong positive correlation between ice cream sales and the number of drowning incidents during the summer months. As ice cream sales increase, the number of drownings also tends to increase.\n",
        "         - Causation: Does eating ice cream cause people to drown? No. While the two are correlated, there is no direct causal link between them.\n",

        "    - In the context of machine learning, an optimizer is an algorithm or method used to minimize (or maximize) the loss function of a model during training. The goal of an optimizer is to find the set of model parameters (weights and biases) that result in the lowest possible loss, leading to better model performance.\n",
        "    - Here are some common types of optimizers:\n",
        "       - Gradient Descent (GD):The most basic optimizer. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters on the entire training dataset. Then, it updates the parameters by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by the learning rate.\n",
        "       - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):Instead of calculating the gradient on the entire dataset, SGD calculates the gradient and updates parameters using only a single randomly selected data point at a time\n",
        "       - Mini-batch Gradient Descent:A compromise between GD and SGD. It calculates the gradient and updates parameters using a small batch of randomly selected data points (typically between 32 and 256) instead of the entire dataset or a single data point.\n",
        "       - Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation): An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. It calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient and the squared gradient. It then uses these moving averages to adapt the learning rate for each parameter individually.\n",
        "17. What is sklearn.linear_model ?\n",
        "    - sklearn.linear_model is a module in Scikit-learn that provides classes and functions to implement linear models for regression and classification.\n",

        "    - Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another, typically to make it suitable for use in machine learning algorithms. In the context of machine learning, it most commonly refers to converting categorical variables (variables that represent categories or labels) into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand and process.\n",
        "    - Most machine learning algorithms are designed to work with numerical data. They perform mathematical operations on the input features to make predictions or classifications. String-based categorical variables, like \"color\" (with values \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\") or \"country\" (with values \"USA\", \"Canada\", \"Mexico\"), cannot be directly used in these calculations. Data encoding addresses this by transforming these categories into numerical representations.\n",
